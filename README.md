# ElevatorSimulator

## Description
This is a CSIM program that models the usage of multiple elevators in a multi-story building. Statistics are generated regarding the usage of these elevators.
I used the rate of people using the elevator in Wingston Chung Hall at UC Riverside over the course of 3 hours to come up with a rate to spawn elevator passengers.
